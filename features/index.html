							Your website should provide up-to-date inventory information, but this can be challenging to keep updated when dealing with large volumes of inventory. DistiSuite makes online inventory information easy to manage.
							<br /><br />
							Most DistiSuite clients automate the updating of their website information.  If you can export your inventory data to a CSV or tab-delimited file, integrating with your DistiSuite website is a breeze.

							Establishing an online presence for your distribution business is increasingly important.  Prospective customers are looking for the products you carry on the web, and driving those customers to your website will generate more sales and relationship opportunities to your business.
							<br /><br />
							Many buyers are using major search engines like Google or Yahoo! to search for products online.  Because we focus on optimizing our DistiSuite websites, our clients products rank prominently in these search engines. A flow of targeted, organic (non-paid) web visitors results in online orders, as well as more RFQs and phone/email inquiries.
							<br /><br />
							DistiSuite also works with vertical search engine providers in the industry, such as EEM, SourceESB, and SupplyFrame, to link their results to your product pages and RFQ form.

							Buyers in wholesale distribution are often interested in quantity breaks, and DistiSuite makes it easy to specify price/quantity breaks for the products you carry on your wbesite.  Our system is flexible to handle different price break structures for different products, so the number of price breaks and quantities used can be configured as you choose.
							<br /><br />
							Further, many distributors are only prepared with pricing for a portion of their inventory, epecially when first launching their sales website.  Ordering can be easily turned off on a product-by-product basis, so the customer can still place an RFQ.
